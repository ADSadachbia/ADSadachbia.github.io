<h1>The meme started</h1>

<p>   
<ul><li>[Raiden crouches on pavement. It is currently raining.]</li></ul>
   
<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
How pleased you are to chop away, Jack the Ripper.
</li></ul>
<hr>
(The camera zooms out, revealing Monsoon kneeling on the top of a skyscraper.)
<hr>

<ul>My name is Monsoon...
Of the winds of destruction.</ul>
    
<ul><li>
  [Raiden]
Yeah... I guessed as much.
</li></ul>

<hr>(Monsoon jumps off the side of the skyscraper, fragmenting into magnetic parts of himself. Jetstream Sam laughs, then shrugs.)<hr> 
     
<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
Feasting on the insides of your enemies.
How easily you ignore the loss of life when it suits your convenience.
So tell me:
Who saves the weak from the one who saves the weak?
</li></ul>

<ul><li>
  [Raiden]
You're the ones exploiting them.
You take advantage of their weakness.
Of course they get hurt, when you set them up as your human shield!
</li></ul>

<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
Kill or be killed, Jack.
Phnom Penh taught me that.
</li></ul>

<hr>(You enter a POV of what Raiden sees.)<hr>
     
<ul>Yes. You aren't the only one to grow up on the killing fields.
War is a cruel parent, but an effective teacher.
Its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche:
That this world and all its people are diseased.
Free Will is a myth; Religion is a joke.
We are all pawns, controlled by something greater:
Memes. The DNA of the soul.
They shape our will.
They are the culture -- they are everything we pass on.
Expose someone to anger long enough, they will learn to hate.
They become a carrier... Envy, Greed, Despair...
All memes. All passed along.</ul>
     
<ul><li>[Raiden]
How about "full of shit"?
Is that a meme?</li></ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
You can't fight nature, Jack.
Wind blows, rain falls, and the strong prey upon the weak.
Sam tells me you see your weapon as a tool.
Something that saves lives -- a means of justice.
Now there's a pretty meme. Exquisite!
It spared you the burden of all the lives you've taken...
...Absolved you of guilt when you enjoyed it.
</li></ul>
     
<hr>(You exit Raiden's POV.)<hr>
     
<ul>That is, until the illusion was broken.
Don't be ashamed.
It's only nature, running its course.
You have no choices to make.
Nothing to answer for.</ul>
     
<hr>(Monsoon takes out two Sais, named Dystopia, twirling them around.)<hr>
     
<ul> You can die with a clear conscience. </ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Raiden]
You're right.
About me, I mean.</li></ul>

<hr>(Monsoon lowers his Sais.)<hr>

<ul>I knew something was... off.
After the Patriots.
I thought I could walk off the battlefield and into a normal life.
But here I am, surrounded by death, arguing philosophy with terrorists.
I told myself this was about Justice.
About protecting the weak.
But I was wrong.</ul>

<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
Then you admit it?</li></ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Raiden]I learned young that killing your enemies felt good. Really good.
In America... my friends... my family...
They helped me forget the Devil inside.
But who am I kidding?
I was BORN to kill!
</li></ul>

<li> The bit about my sword -- that "means of Justice" stuff?
I guess I needed something to keep "the Ripper" in-check when I was knee-deep in bodies.</ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Monsoon, in a disgruntled voice]
You...
</li></ul>
     
<ul><li>[Raiden]
     But you -- all this -- is a wake-up call to what I really believe.
     To what I really am.</li></ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Monsoon]
What are you saying?
</li></ul>
     
<ul><li>
  [Raiden]
I'm saying Jack Is Back.
</li></ul>
